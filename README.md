# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project
This project demonstrates my skills in cleaning and transforming raw data using SQL. The dataset, Nashville Housing Data, contains details such as property addresses, sale prices, and owner information. I applied several data cleaning techniques to standardize and prepare the data for analysis.

## Key Steps:

- Standardized date formats for consistency.
- Populated missing property addresses using Parcel IDs.
- Split address fields into individual components (e.g., street, city, state).
- Transformed binary fields (e.g., "Y" to "Yes", "N" to "No") for better readability.
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns to optimize the dataset.
- The cleaned dataset is ready for advanced analysis and insights generation. Check out the SQL scripts used for this project in the repository!
